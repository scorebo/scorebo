ons for installing and running the Cosmological Benchmark instance. 

The benchmark aims at finding the best parameter setting in a physical simulator.
CAMB is the simulator and LRGDR calculates the likelihood of a given parameter setting.

The setup requires an old version of CAMB with patches from the LRGDR7 software.
CAMB performs the simulation from a parameters file and outputs a metrics file. LRGDR then reads this metric file.
In scorebo, we then run the cosmological benchmark from "botorch/benchmarking/cosmo_task.py" that takes a parameter set as input, modifies the 
CAMB parameters file, calls CAMB, then calls LRGDR7 and reads and returns the output.

For the installation, you first need to make sure you have fortran running. Test by "ifort --version".

Go to the camb folder. 

Next you need to download CAMB.

For this installation
we already provide the patched version of CAMB, but you need to download the LRGDR7 software. 

Installation of CAMB:
We use the Feb2009 version tagged with Feb09. Download it from https://github.com/cmbant/CAMB/releases/tag/Feb09. 

Installation of LRGD:
Download LRGDR7 from https://ascl.net/1306.012.

Patch and make CAMB:
Move the inidriver.F90 module.f90, bsplinepk.c and Makefile from the lrgdr7like/CAMBfeb09patch to CAMB-Feb09 replacing where needed.
Modify the Makefile in CAMB-Feb09 for your system. (I removed the -arch CFLAG, the -fpp2 -vec_report0 FFLAGS and changed openmp to qopenmp).
run make
test by running ./camb params.ini

Make LRGDR7:
Go the the lrgdr-folder and run make all


Lastly, if you want to run cosmo without SCOreBO you need to to connect lrgdr7 to camb by setting the path
output_root = ../lrgdr7like/models/lrgdr7model
in the params.ini file in camb. In ScoreBO however, however, this is done automatically in cosmo_task.py.
